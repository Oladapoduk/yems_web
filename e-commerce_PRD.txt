I want to build a modern e-commerce website that allows customers to browse, search, and purchase the following categories:

Frozen Fish
Seafood
Meat
Groceries
Packaged Foods
Drinks
Each category has:
Product grid
Product images
Pricing
Weight (e.g., 800-1200g)
Availability (in stock / out of stock)

Below is the PRD:
1. Product Overview

This product is a modern e-commerce website that allows customers to browse, search, and purchase frozen fish and grocery items online. The platform supports individual customers and small businesses (B2B buyers) with end-to-end order processing, delivery slot selection, and post-purchase notifications.

The business sells products that require controlled handling (frozen seafood), so logistics, delivery rules, allergens, and compliance must be carefully built into the system.

2. Goals & Objectives
🎯 Primary Goals

Enable customers to browse and buy frozen fish and groceries online.

Provide a smooth, modern shopping experience.

Ensure food-safe delivery, including time slots and zone restrictions.

Support wholesale/B2B buyers with recurring orders and VAT documentation.

📈 Business Goals

Increase online sales and automate order processing.

Expand customer reach beyond walk-in store traffic.

Reduce manual ordering (WhatsApp/Phone) and streamline fulfillment.

3. Target Users
👤 User Group A: Everyday Shoppers

Wants convenient access to frozen fish and groceries.

Browses categories or uses search.

Expects accurate delivery time, slot selection, and pricing.

🧑‍💼 User Group B: Small Businesses (Restaurants, Takeaways)

Need bulk purchasing.

Require VAT invoices.

Order the same items weekly → need fast reorders.

Rely heavily on accurate delivery schedules.

K. Pricing & Weight Logic

Question to resolve:

If customer orders “1kg Snapper” but stock available is 1.2kg, pricing must use one of:

Fixed Price Per Item (recommended)

Customer pays same amount regardless of slight weight variation

Price Per Kg (variable pricing)

Customer is charged after actual weight is confirmed

Requires “Adjust Final Price” workflow in admin

The PRD must support either method.

Order list

Cancel / Refund

Mark as “Out for Delivery”

Mark as “Delivered”

“Your exact item is unavailable. Would you like:
A) Substitute product
B) Refund for this item?”

Customer must confirm before delivery is dispatched
